URL::Grab
=========

URL::Grab is a perl module that drastically simplifies the fetching of files.
It is designed to be used in programs that need common (but not necessarily
simple) url-fetching features. It is extremely simple to drop into an
existing program and provides a clean interface to protocol-independant
file-access. Best of all, URL::Grab takes care of all those pesky
file-fetching details, and lets you focus on whatever it is that your program
is written to do!

URL::Grab came into existence as the part of Config::YUM that downloads remote
yum-configs and header files, but it quickly became clear that this is a
general problem that many applications must deal with. 

Yes, URL::Grab has been heavily inspired by the famous Python urlgrabber. :-)
